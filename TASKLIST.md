# User Management with Service Enablement - Tightly Coupled Iterative Plan

## Principle: Every Backend Change Has Immediate UI Reflection
No table, field, or endpoint exists without being visible and usable in the UI in the same task.

---

## Task 1: Add User Roles - Full Stack
**What you'll see:** Role badge appears in dashboard showing "Admin" or "User"

**Changes:**
1. **Schema**: Add `role` enum + field to users table (default: "user")
2. **Backend**: Update auth endpoints to return `role` in response
3. **Backend**: Add `role` to JWT payload
4. **Frontend**: Store role in auth state
5. **Frontend**: Add role badge to dashboard header
6. **Test in browser**: Register → see "User" badge appear

**Database:**
```typescript
// shared/schema.ts
export const userRoleEnum = pgEnum("user_role", ["admin", "user"]);
role: userRoleEnum("role").notNull().default("user")
```

**API Response:**
```json
{ "token": "...", "user": { "id": "...", "email": "...", "role": "user" } }
```

**UI Location:** Dashboard header (top right near services)

**Acceptance:** Role badge visible for all logged-in users

---

## Task 2: First User Auto-Admin - Full Stack
**What you'll see:** First registered user gets "Admin" badge, second user gets "User" badge

**Changes:**
1. **Backend**: In register/uuid-login, check user count
2. **Backend**: If count = 0, set role to "admin"
3. **Frontend**: Show toast when promoted: "You are the first user - promoted to Admin!"
4. **Test in browser**: 
   - Delete all users from DB
   - Register → see "Admin" badge + toast
   - Register second user → see "User" badge

**Logic:**
```typescript
const userCount = await storage.getUserCount();
const role = userCount === 0 ? "admin" : "user";
```

**Acceptance:** First user is admin, subsequent users are regular users, visible immediately

---

## Task 3: Differentiate Admin vs User Dashboard - Full Stack
**What you'll see:** Admins see full dashboard, regular users see empty dashboard with removed sections

**Changes:**
1. **Frontend**: Add role-based conditional rendering to dashboard

3. **Frontend**: For user: Show empty state with message
4. **Frontend**: Hide services card grid for regular users
5. **Frontend**: Hide config section for regular users
6. **Frontend**: Hide API docs section for regular users
7. **Frontend**: Hide widget section for regular users
8. **Frontend**: Remove navigation links to hidden sections for users
9. **Test in browser**:

   - Regular user can't access /config, /api-docs, /widget (redirect to dashboard)

**Empty State Message:**
```
"Welcome to AuthHub"
"Your account is set up. Access to services is managed by your administrator."
```

**UI Changes:**
- Dashboard page has conditional rendering based on `userRole`
- Navigation links hidden for regular users
- Protected routes redirect non-admins to dashboard

**Acceptance:** Regular users see minimal empty dashboard, admins see everything

---

## Task 4: User Management Page with Admin Navbar - Full Stack
**What you'll see:** Admins see "User Management" link in navbar leading to a page with all users in a table

**Changes:**

3. **Frontend**: Add "User Management" link to navbar (conditional on admin role)
4. **Frontend**: Create User Management page at `/admin/users` with full user table
5. **Frontend**: Add route protection (redirects non-admins to dashboard)
6. **Frontend**: Table shows: UUID, email, role badge, created date, services count (0 for now)
7. **Frontend**: Add search functionality to filter users
8. **Test in browser**:
   - Login as admin → see "User Management" in navbar
   - Click link → see table with all users and their roles
   - Register new user → appears in table immediately
   - Login as regular user → navbar item hidden, direct access redirected to dashboard

**Table Columns:**
- UUID (with copy button)
- Email (or "Anonymous")
- Role (Admin/User badge)
- Created (date + time)
- Services (count - shows "0" for now)

**UI Location:** New navbar link + new page at /admin/users

---

## Testing Protocol (After Each Task)

1. **Apply changes**: `npm run db:push` (or `--force` if needed)
2. **Restart workflow**: Automatic on file save
3. **Open browser**: Test the specific UI changes described
4. **Verify persistence**: Refresh page, changes should persist
5. **Check previous tasks**: Make sure nothing broke
6. **Check console**: No errors in browser console

---

## Rollback Strategy

Each task is atomic. If something breaks:
1. Revert code changes for that task only
2. Run `npm run db:push --force` if schema changed
3. All previous tasks remain working
4. Debug and retry

---

## Key Differences from Previous Plan

✅ **Every task has UI changes** - Nothing is backend-only
✅ **Immediate visibility** - Every change shows in browser right away
✅ **Tight coupling** - Schema + API + UI all in one task
✅ **Can demo after each task** - Show working feature after every task
✅ **Easy debugging** - Small changes, easy to find issues
